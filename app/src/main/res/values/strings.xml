    <!--about us-->

    <string name="about_us_title">Team Everest was started in August, 2006</string>

    <string name="about_us_description">Our first activity was to collect around Rs. 4000 from four people who contributed it from their first monthâ€™s salary. We donated uniforms and notebooks to few students in a rural school in Sirumoor (Tiruvannamalai Dt, Tamilnadu, India). From there on, we have grown from strength to strength. More than nine years have passed and now we have 9500+ Volunteers helping people across India by giving time, their skills and money. We love volunteering. Our objective is to promote volunteering by motivating individuals to volunteer atleast once a month (12/365) and make a difference by providing quality education to less privileged children through volunteering.</string>
